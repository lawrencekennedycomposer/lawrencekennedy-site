      <h2>1. The Story as Humanity’s First Operating System</h2>
      <p>For tens of thousands of years, stories were the invisible scaffolding that held communities together.
      From the <strong>Dreamtime</strong> stories of First Nations peoples to the parables of the desert, from the myths of Olympus to the scriptures of hierarchical religion, humanity has always used narrative to remember who we are and how to live.
      Before there were laws, there were fables that carried the same authority—less a commandment, more a mirror.
      They spoke in symbols that stirred emotion long before reason: generosity sustained life, arrogance invited storms, compassion restored balance.
      These were not tales for amusement but tools for alignment.
      Story was the moral architecture beneath civilisation—the operating system of empathy that kept the collective mind coherent.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>2. The Golden Age of the Moral Tale</h2>
      <p>As belief systems loosened, the sacred story slipped into art and theatre.
      The Renaissance widened perspective—not only in paintings but in the human mind.
      The stage became a new kind of temple: Shakespeare’s characters wrestled with honour, love, ambition, guilt.
      Tragedy replaced punishment; comedy replaced sermon.
      Later, print and film inherited the same moral grammar.
      Even when religion faded, its structure endured—cause and consequence, flaw and redemption.
      Early cinema still closed with quiet certainty: <em>crime doesn’t pay</em>, <em>a man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do.</em>
      Each story left the audience fed—simple ingredients, but enough to feel complete.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. The Attention Economy Arrives</h2>
      <p>Then came the algorithm, and storytelling changed species.
      The narrative stopped waiting for us to sit down; it began chasing us instead.
      The feed replaced the fire, dispensing emotion in fragments measured by reaction rather than reflection.
      Meaning became optional—what mattered was the pulse, the click, the next micro-burst of feeling.
      A good story once lingered like a balanced meal; now it dissolves on the tongue before thought begins.
      Fear sells, outrage spreads, pity trends.
      We are surrounded by sensation yet starved for sequence—fed constantly, but never nourished.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>4. Consequences of Empty Calories</h2>
      <p>A diet of emotional sugar leaves society jittery, defensive, and perpetually hungry for meaning.
      We scroll, we react, but we rarely digest.
      The loss isn’t intelligence—it’s integration.
      We have more information than any culture in history, but less shared narrative to bind it together.
      Without that slow-cooked story structure, empathy fragments into tribes of stimulus response.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. The Emotional Marketplace</h2>
      <p>In the attention economy, emotion has replaced storytelling as the main unit of exchange.
      A story once needed a plot, a theme, a moral. Now it just needs to <em>feel.</em>
      Algorithms don’t care about meaning—they care about what keeps the finger scrolling.
      And not all emotions are created equal. Some take effort to earn—wonder, gratitude, compassion—while others can be triggered in a single frame.
      The system has learned to buy low and sell fast: outrage, envy, fear, ridicule.
      They’re cheaper to produce and far more addictive.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>6. The Shortcuts</h2>
      <p><strong>Fear</strong> is still the oldest trick in the book. News headlines, disaster thumbnails, and end-of-the-world predictions all play in the same minor key. Fear demands vigilance—and vigilance keeps us watching.</p>
      <p><strong>Outrage</strong> is fear’s social sibling. It flatters our sense of moral superiority. Every viral clip of a “Karen,” every political meltdown, every takedown thread feeds the audience a hit of righteousness. We scroll not for information but for validation: proof that we’re still on the right side of the fire.</p>
      <p><strong>Schadenfreude</strong>—pleasure in someone else’s humiliation—fuels prank culture and fail compilations. It’s bonding through derision, the digital version of a crowd jeering in the square.</p>
      <p><strong>Disgust</strong> taps an older survival reflex. It’s why crime shows and conspiracy feeds perform so well. Disgust holds our attention by convincing the brain there’s a threat to purity or safety.</p>
      <p>And then there’s <strong>tribal pride</strong>, the sugar-free variant. Memes and in-jokes about “our side” reward belonging. They’re not about hating the other; they’re about confirming that <em>we</em> exist—and that we’re smarter, funnier, or more awake than everyone else.</p>
      <p>Each of these emotions is a handle the system can grab to keep us engaged. They’re predictable, measurable, and optimisable—the perfect ingredients for a <strong>bag of assorted lollies</strong>: bright, fast, and fleetingly satisfying. It tastes good in the moment, but you’re never full.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>7. Why Negativity Wins</h2>
      <p>Humans evolved to notice what’s wrong before we notice what’s right. It kept our ancestors alive, but in a world of infinite signals, that same reflex turns against us. Outrage and fear outperform calm reflection by several orders of magnitude. Platforms don’t promote negativity because they’re evil—they do it because it works. Anything that raises the heart rate, tightens the jaw, or makes us type before we think will outperform content that asks us to breathe and consider. The algorithm doesn’t reward truth; it rewards <strong>alertness</strong>—and outrage is permanent alertness.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>8. The Cost</h2>
      <p>When every emotion is engineered for reaction, empathy becomes a liability. It’s slow, quiet, and hard to monetise. A reflective mind is a poor consumer. So the modern storyteller doesn’t need believers; it needs participants—people who will react on cue. The more polarised and exhausted we become, the better the numbers look. In this new religion, engagement has replaced enlightenment.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>9. Recovering the Meal</h2>
      <p>The solution isn’t to delete our apps or burn the digital village. It’s to remember what stories were meant to do. They were recipes for meaning—slow-cooked wisdom that nourished community and conscience. They taught cause and consequence, empathy and restraint. They didn’t just keep people entertained; they kept people <em>human.</em></p>
      <p>Now, surrounded by an all-you-can-eat buffet of emotional junk food, we need to relearn how to cook. We can’t expect algorithms to feed us well; they were built to feed on us. But we can start to notice what leaves us hungry. We can choose stories that stretch rather than spike, that leave us thinking instead of twitching. We can start seeking narrative nutrition—books, films, conversations, and even memes that rebuild the muscle of attention instead of burning it out.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>10. Story Literacy</h2>
      <p>If earlier ages taught us to read words, the next one must teach us to read <em>narratives.</em> Story literacy means recognising the emotional bait before we bite. It means asking simple questions:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>“What is this trying to make me feel?”<br>
        “Who benefits from that feeling?”<br>
        “Is there a slower, truer version of this story?”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The point isn’t cynicism—it’s awareness. A society that can watch without worship, feel without manipulation, is a society with a chance of finding its moral compass again.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>11. The Next Generation’s Firewall</h2>
      <p>And all is not lost. Despite the noise, younger people are showing signs of growing up with sharper filters than we did. Teenagers raised in the thick of information chaos often develop an instinctive <strong>BS detector</strong>—they can spot performative outrage and hollow virtue faster than most adults. They may scroll more, but they also believe less. Without the shock value that once captured older generations, they’ve had to evolve subtler forms of discernment. It’s rough, imperfect, and still forming—but it’s there. Where our attention was easily stolen, theirs may become tougher to hack.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>12. The New Fire</h2>
      <p>Our ancestors gathered around fires to share stories that helped them survive. We gather around screens for the same reason, but the fire has changed. It burns hotter now—brighter, louder, endlessly fed by the kindling of our emotions. We can’t put it out, but we can remember why we lit it in the first place. Stories were meant to illuminate, not to blind. They were meant to keep us warm, not to keep us burning.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Epilogue</h2>
      <p>The next evolution of storytelling won’t come from a new platform or a smarter algorithm. It will come from people remembering how to listen, how to imagine, and how to tell stories that feed, not consume, the mind.</p>
